# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The  goal of this exercise is to analyze the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019  for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. In first step, a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type will be created. In second step, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type will be created. 

## Results
The ride sharing data based on city type is presented in the following table.

* It is clear that the Urban areas have the largest number of rides, largest number of drivers and total fares. Suburban areas have the second largest total rides and total number of drivers. Rural areas have the smallest number of rides and drivers and accordingly the smallest total fares.

* This pattern can be explained by the fact that simply more people live (and use the app) in urban areas than suburban and rural cities. So, there is more demand for rides and drivers in urban areas compared to suburban and rural areas.  
* Also, the summary table shows that the average ride fare per ride and the average fare per driver is highest in rural areas and lowest in urban areas with suburban areas fall between rural and urban.

* This pattern can be explained by the fact that there are fewer drivers available in suburban and specially in rural areas that cannot respond to the demand and that probably causing the ride fare goes up.  

* Despite the fact that Urban areas have the lowest average fare, but they collectively provide close to 40k the Pyber’s revenue in this period of time. (that’s more than 60% of the total revenue). 

A plot showing the total weekly fare for each city type for a period for 15 weeks between January and May is presented below.

It is noted that the total fares for urban areas are highest for the entire time of study (Jan -May) and the rural area’s fares are the lowest. It is also noted that while the total fares fluctuate form week to week, the fluctuations are larger in urban and suburban areas compared to rural areas. All three different areas show a peak in total revenue around week number 8.


## Summary
* Considering most of the revenue is coming from Urban areas, increase driver’s payment in urban areas to attract more drivers. That will ultimately increase company’s revenue.
* In the period between March and April, it seems the demand for ride in urban areas remains very high while suburban fares remain flat.  To accommodate the asymmetry, set a policy to encourage suburban drivers take rides in urban areas by increasing their payment.
* Suburban areas seem to be an ideal place for ride sharing app because drivers earn relatively good money (39.5$ compared to 16.5$ in urban). At the same time they provide about half of the revenue of the urban areas for Pyber. PyBer need to invest in suburban areas to increase their market there.
